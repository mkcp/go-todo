# go-todo
Sometimes you gotta just make a todo app to remember how to write funny little programs.

There's a toy loading spinner in here with a state machine and animation frames that I'm fairly happy with. Always
wanted to make something that writes in place in the CLI, and it was simpler than I expected it would be. Yippee!
